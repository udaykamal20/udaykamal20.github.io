Hi, I am Uday! I am a third year ECE PhD student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/saibal-mukhopadhyay). 

My research interests lie broadly in building computationally efficient, intelligent perception-capable systems. I am also interested in emergent Memory models, World models, and Embodied AI. Currently, I'm working on memory-augmented spatiotemporal representation learning with an application towards event-based perception.
