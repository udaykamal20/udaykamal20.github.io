Hi, I am Uday! I am a final year ECE PhD student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/saibal-mukhopadhyay). 

My research interests lie broadly in building computationally efficient, intelligent perception-capable systems. I am also interested in Robot Learning, World Models, and Embodied AI. Currently, I'm working on memory-augmented spatiotemporal representation learning with an application towards event-based perception.

Before starting my Ph.D., I finished my undergraduate in EEE from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology [(BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/) where I have worked on several research projects related to Computer Vision (small object detection, and segmentation), ML-assisted medical image synthesis, and analysis.
